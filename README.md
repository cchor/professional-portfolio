## Professional Portfolio

This project is to create a portfolio to be able to build upon for future use. Having a good portfolio showcases your skills to potential employeers. 

Creating this portfolio was an exercise in creating a responsive design that adapts to different size screens without impacting user experience. We used what we learned about using pseudo-classes, css selectors and variables.
